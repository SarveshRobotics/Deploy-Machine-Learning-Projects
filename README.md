# Deploy-Machine-Learning-Objects
Deploying ML models into the clouds

Recently, I came across real life roadblocks. Roadblocks students like me face while moving from University based projects to Industry scaled products. There is only one way out, learning the nuances of scalable deployments. In this repo, I will start with basic level to industry level deployment models:

### 1. PyTorch, Flask and Docker.  
- [ ] Completed
  In this web application, I am going to host an Image Colorization web application which you can run local to colorize an image.

### 2. PyTorch, Flask, Docker and Heroku.  
- [ ] Completed

### 3. . . .
